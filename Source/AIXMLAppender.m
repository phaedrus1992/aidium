/* TODO:
- Better error handling
- Possible support for "healing" a damaged XML file?
- Possibly refactor the initializeDocument... and appendElement... methods to return a BOOL and/or RBR an error code of
some kind to indicate success or failure.
- Instead of just testing for ' ' in -rootElementNameForFileAtPath:, use NSCharacterSet and be more general.
