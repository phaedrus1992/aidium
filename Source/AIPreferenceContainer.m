/*!
 * @brief Preference Container
 *
 * A single AIPreferenceContainer instance provides read/write access preferences to a specific preference group, either
 * for the global preferences or for a specific object.
 *
 * All contacts share a single plist on-disk, loaded into a single mutable dictionary in-memory, objectPrefs.
 * All accounts share a single plist on-disk, loaded into a single mutable dictionary in-memory, accountPrefs.
 * These global dictionaries provide per-object preference dictionaries, keyed by the object's internalObjectID.
 *
 * Individual instances of AIPreferenceContainer make use of this shared store.  Saving of changes is batched for all
 * changes made during a SAVE_OBJECT_PREFS_DELAY interval across all instances of AIPreferenceContainer for a given
 * global dictionary. Because creating the data representation of a large dictionary and writing it out can be
 * time-consuming (certainly less than a second, but still long enough to cause a perceptible delay for a user actively
 * typing or interacting with Adium), saving is performed on a thread.
