 * This class implements the state system behavior for auto-reply.  If auto-reply status is active on an account,
 * initial messages recieved on that account will be replied to automatically.  Subsequent messages will not receive
 * a reply unless the chat window is closed.
 *
 * This is the expected behavior on certain protocols such as AIM, and considered a convenience on other protocols.
